# Just Chat

Just Chat is an internet-based messaging app similar to WhatsApp. A service called Firebase Firestore is used as a backend database to store and retrieve messages from the cloud. Just chat is a companion project to The App Brewery's Complete App Developement Bootcamp.

Due to the scope of the project, the app doesn't allow users to select another user to chat with.
